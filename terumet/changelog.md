## Terumetal mod changelog
Newer versions listed first

## Version 2.0
### (full documentation still in progress)
* **Breaking change** API for creating 'custom' heat machines has completely changed. Custom machines for versions prior to 2.0 will _not_ work in 2.0. See tmapisample/init.lua for a complete example of how the newer, much more flexible API works -- any type of machine is now possible to create. More info will be coming soon.
* The highest-tier heater has been added: the **Environmental Entropy Extraction Heater**! This powerful machine extracts latent entropy from the environment around it and creates Heat energy. To be more blunt, it will degrade and/or cool nodes in an area around it to create large amounts of heat for other machines.
    * For example: after being extracted, stone becomes cobblestone which will then become gravel then silver sand. Each step after a pass of the Extraction Heater will generate heat from the transformation. There are many possible transformations depending on the environment around the heater, and also Air nodes will provide a limitless supply of heat, though quite slowly.
    * By default, the machine operates in a 5x5x5 cube around itself. (see options.lua to change this)
    * This presently is the most expensive item to create in the mod, and for good reason as it can provide essentially limitless heat for machines.
* Major formspec design overhaul, both visually and under the hood. This was the bulk of the change in 2.0.
* Heat Generation Upgrades now have a function in general machines: 
    * When in any machine that has a fuel slot, this upgrade increases the heat gained from direct fuel by 30% (ex: lava bucket 2000 HU --> 2600 HU)

### Version 1.11
* All Terumetal Alloy Smelter recipies have been rebalanced and now ingots of base metals can be used (i.e. Gold Ingot can be inserted to alloy Terugold) -- ingot recipes are basically equivalent, just a bit faster to alloy.
* Since it is an alloy, basic Minetest Bronze can now be alloyed in the Alloy Smelter from 8 copper + 1 tin (just like the hand recipe). This recipe does not use any Terumetal flux.
    * To help avoid confusing or unintentional alloying of what you don't want now that there are two recipes that use copper, the Alloy Smelter now has a UI button that enables/disables zero-flux recipies. If you don't want to accidentally create bronze because there's no flux in the tank, deactivate zero-flux recipes.
* The new recipes made possible due to the fact the Smelter now can handle recipies with an output with stack sizes > 1.
    * For example, when alloying Teruchalcum you no longer get a bad deal out of it. Three ingots worth of stuff goes in and three ingots now come out.

### Version 1.10
* Upgrade system for machines implemented! Machines that support upgrades have slots for them on the right side of their GUI vertically. Only a single upgrade of a particular type has any effect, so adding mutiple of the same type or trying to force in a stack bigger than 1 accomplishes nothing. The following upgrades are implemented:
    * External Input Upgrade: Removes the input slots from the machine's GUI and instead pulls items from the node to the left of the machine (when viewed from the front). This includes chests and any other node that has a "main" inventory.
    * External Output Upgrade: Removes the output slots from the machine's GUI and instead places output items into the node to the right of the machine (when viewed from the front). This includes chests and any other node that has a "main" inventory.
    * Maximum Heat Upgrade: Increases the maximum heat the machine can store so it may run longer without needing reheating. If the upgrade is removed and heat is above the standard maximum, the machine will slowly vent excess heat until back to normal and will not act normally until that occurs.
    * Heat Transfer Upgrade: When placed in a machine that sends heat to others, greatly increases the amount of heat it can send at once. Additionally, when placed in a machine that receives heat from others, it increases the amount of heat it can receive from any other machine by a bit.
    * Heat Generation Upgrade: Roughly doubles the amount of heat Furnace Heaters and Solar Heaters can generate.
    * Speed Upgrade: A highly lucrative upgrade that generally halves the amount of time for any machine to do its process, though it will consume the same amount of heat. It also halves the time fuel in a Furnace Heater takes to burn, but additionally doubles the rate of heat generated to make it even.
    * Crystallization Upgrade: The most specialized upgrade but likely the most powerful. When placed in a Crystal Vulcanizer, the yield of crystals it creates increases from 2 per raw item to 3 crystals each, making it triple normal yield. However, the time and heat cost it takes also increases very considerably.
* The mystique of heat power and its measurement is now gone; the actual number of HU (heat units) in a machine are now shown on their GUIs, underneath the heat bar.
* The front of Crystal Vulcanizers now has a different texture to differentiate it from its sides.
* Last but not least, Thermoboxes finally function! They are a combination heat-storage device and also director of heat. Five of its six sides (blue marked ones) act as usual inputs from adjacent heaters, HEAT rays or even other thermoboxes, while its output (the orange-marked side) will send heat to an adjacent machine.
* To accompany the Thermobox, its slightly cheaper and opposite cousin the Thermal Distributor has been added as well. It doesn't store nearly as much heat, but given a heat input on its blue side it will equally distribute heat to machines at its orange sides.

### Version 1.9
* "Solar Glass" is now "Heat-transference Glass" to reflect its expanded use. Additionally, you now get 3 of them for one recipe.
* Some overdue graphic cleanup and changes have been made.
* The Teruchalcum is always greener on the other version.
    * More seriously, the look of Teruchalcum was changed slightly to be shinier and greenier.
* The ore-cutting saw is now a proper size when wielded.
* Overdue but finally: You can use pure terumetal ingots in the Alloy Smelter as flux. Smelting terumetal lumps no longer makes them useless for alloying! This should have been the case since multiple flux items were implemented, but...
* The first Coreglass Framed machine has now been added: HEAT Ray Emitters! This amazing device takes heat like any other machine but is made to transmit it over long distances. Using a standard screwdriver, rotate the emitter so its brightly-colored output side points to and is aligned with another machine far away. After a period where it seeks out a target (the longer distance, the longer it takes) it will fire a High Energy Alpha-wave Trasmission beam, sending a large amount of heat from its own storage to that machine.
    * You can change settings regarding the particle effects for the ray and whether it displays a "seeking" effect while searching in options.lua
* Additionally, a much less expensive HEAT Ray Reflector block was added to assist with sending HEAT Rays around corners. A Reflector points in only one direction, but any rays that strike it from any of the other sides will be sent through the direction it points. HEAT Ray Emitters take Reflectors into consideration automatically when seeking.

### Version 1.8
* **POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE**: Machines in the world before 1.8 will not appear to have any input slots because of a inventory list-name change due to new API update. Re-placing the machine should fix this but will not drop items in 'old' input slots. I suggest removing any input items left in the slots before updating to 1.8 to prevent losing any items.
* API Expansion: now submods can easily create new custom heat machines that can process items. see 'custom_sample' included with the development files for a simple example of how to use this new API. While the example works, there may still be bugs in custom machines. Please report any if you run into them!

### Version 1.7
* New alloy added that uses the remaining minetest metals: Teruchalcum, made from standard minetest Bronze, additional Tin, and Terumetal flux in the Alloy Smelter! Mostly an excellent mid-tier tool metal at this point that creates fast and extremely long-lasting tools for usual exploring and mining.
* All machines now 'save' their heat when broken! If a machine has been placed in the world before, it will state 'Heat: X%' in its tooltip and will retain that amount when re-placed. **REMEMBER** though: if a machine is in the middle of processing something and you break it, what was being processed will be lost! Any items in the input and output slots will be dropped, but anything mid-process will not!
* The Solar Heater is now much more difficult to exploit with artificial light. ONLY sunlight will do now.
* Ore-cutting Saw (name was changed since WIP stage) is now implemented and effective. With this tool you can instantly excavate any ore node to collect them whole. Mostly useful for Diamond Ore and Mese Ore, which can be Vulcanized into Crystallized Diamonds/Mese (thus doubling the usual mining yield)
    * Ore-cutting Saw as a method to get whole ore nodes are also shown in unified_inventory
* Damage of alloy Swords changed to more appropriate values, and can now be easily changed in options.lua
* Fixed duplication exploit of Terumetal via breaking Alloy Smelters and recrystallizing the dropped lumps: alloy smelter now drops crystallized terumetal instead

### Version 1.6
* Furnace Heater added: use standard furnace fuel for generating heat
* Solar Heater added: use (sun)light for generating heat
* Heat transfer between machines implemented, currently only adjacently. Either heater will send heat to any adjacent heat machines that need it, split evenly.
* A lot of internal work on moving code out of specific machines and into general use
* Furnace heater looks like old alloy smelter, Alloy Smelter has new appearance
* Machines now react instantly to items being inserted/removed rather than with a delay

### Version 1.5
* Unified_inventory support expanded: Flux items for smelter and crystal vulcanizer recipes added
* API for other mods to easily add new recipes to the alloy smelter and define new crystals for vulcanizer to create added under interop/terumet_api.lua
* Crystallized forms of metals added. Similar to the classic concept of 'grinding' ore into dusts to multiply yield, a Crystal Vulcanizer machine now exists that takes ore lumps or other raw materials and purifies and crystallizes them through extreme temperature processing. Currently Vulcanizer provides 2 crystallized metals for 1 input, but this is planned to be based on machine setup in future.
* Internal structure of alloy smelter recipes rewritten -- old system turned out to be flawed because multiple ways to create the same item were impossible. This has been fixed but I'm sorry if it broke anything RSL_Redstonier :(
* A new heating method other than buckets of lava is now available: heated thermese blocks. Place a block of thermese adjacent to lava in the world and it will heat up enough to use as a small heat boost in a machine. Renewable because it doesn't consume the lava! (much more to come when it comes to providing heat to machines)

### Version 1.4
* Alloy items ID change (sorry if anything breaks!)
* Addition of machine frames, node design contributed by RSL-Redstonier
* Alloy smelter has new recipe based on new machine frames
* Addition of high-temperature furnace! (still using smeltery gui mostly though)
* Change to lightning effects for machinery, now lights when in use rather than when heated

### Version 1.3
* Reorganized file structure (minimal gameplay effects)
* Added textures for future items
* Implemented support for mod unified_inventory - now alloy smelter recipes are listed along with the required flux and time it takes. This was much easier than I thought it would be!

### Version 1.2
* Made particle effects functional - smelter smokes when working. Uses a texture from default mod presently but this should be changed...eventually
* Added new items and alloying recipes for creating them: Teruceramic and Thermese, from clay and mese respectively. Currently both are only usable to create blocks and back, but both will be important materials for future machines and tools.

### Version 1.1
* What the Smelter is currently processing now displays on the GUI in the center, rather than just in text.
* To make it feel a bit less pointless, when the lava in the Smelter is fully used up you now get regular stone (aka smooth stone) back instead of cobblestone. Saves you a little cooking cobblestone I guess?
* The smelter now lights up and changes textures when there is heat.
* The groundwork for particle effects is there but still not apparently functional. TODO.
* It's no longer possible to theoretically get a Smelter 'stuck' without heat and not showing the fuel slot because the heat-using system was completely rewritten.
* Because of the new heat system, a bucket of lava will not be consumed until the Smelter needs it to process something.
* A lot of under-the-hood stuff to make future new machines much easier to make
