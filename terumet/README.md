# Terumetal [terumet]
### Current release version: v1.10
A mod for the open-source voxel game Minetest (https://www.minetest.net/)

Creates a new ore in the world which can be used to make useful alloys from many already available materials.

### Changelog
See the changelog [Here](changelog.md)

## Installing
Download the working v1.10 release from [Here](https://github.com/Terumoc/terumet/releases/tag/v1.10)
or the current repo version [Here](https://github.com/Terumoc/terumet/archive/master.zip) (may NOT be functional).

Unzip the folder into a temporary space then move/copy the subfolder **terumet** into your minetest **mods** folder.

**The items outside of that folder are development files and are *not needed* to use the mod.**

## Mod Dependencies
This mod depends on:
* default
* bucket
* screwdriver

All above mods should normally be included already if playing the default Minetest subgame.

Additonal **optional** support for:
* unified_inventory

# Overview/Tutorial

(Images are from v1.0 and may not be entirely accurate. The information continues to be, however.)

## Worldgen
The only new thing generated in the world is a new type of ore:

![Terumetal Ore](tutorial/ore_stone.png)

Which can be found in stone or desert stone:

![Terumetal Desert Ore](tutorial/ore_desert_stone.png)

Like any other standard Minetest ore mining it provides you with one or more raw lumps of ore, which can be cooked in a furnace to create ingots.

Do not make too many ingots from this new ore though because it is much better used as a flux for alloying than by itself; most tools made from raw Terumetal Ore will be very brittle and break quickly. In a pinch they *can* be useful since they are capable of digging very hard material quickly (and curiously, *ONLY* very hard material) but will only last a few blocks worth of digging.

## Alloy Smelter
The real use of Terumetal Ingots is creating an Alloy Smelter. First you'll need some intermediate materials that use them:

![Pure Terumetal Coil Recipe](tutorial/coil_recipe.PNG)

You'll need heating coils made from pure terumetal. Note that you'll get 8 from the recipe so you only need to do this once.

![Terumetal Frame Recipe](tutorial/frame_recipe.PNG)

Additionally, you'll need a basic Terumetal Machine Frame like above. The copper block might seem out of place, but in the final machine it acts as a rudimentary 'battery' for the heat it uses to function. All Terumetal machinery runs on heat, so every machine frame has some sort of heat-storing element in the center.

Once you have both of these materials, you're ready to make the Alloy Smelter itself:

![Alloy Smelter Recipe](tutorial/smelter_recipe.png)

Place the smelter block down somewhere and you can then right-click it to access its interface like a standard furnace:

![Alloy Smelter GUI](tutorial/smelter_gui.png)

Before you begin using it it's important to understand two things about the Alloy Smelter:
1. It requires heat to do anything.
2. The flux metal used to alloy with other materials is melted first and stored inside.

One helpful thing to keep in mind is that unlike vanilla Minetest furnaces, all Terumetal machines will drop their contents when you break it and also will retain heat inside them (visible in the tool tip) for when you place them again. Specifically for the Alloy Smelter, thanks to some form of instant heat transfer technology any molten flux metal left in the internal tank will be dropped as crystallized Terumetal when broken and thus reusuable later just at the cost of the heat and time to re-melt them.

### Heating Machinery
(updated for v1.6+)

The starter method of heating is with a bucket of lava placed in the fuel slot of a machine. Your empty bucket will be returned.

Once up and running, you have many further options for how to heat machinery. The most straightforward is alloying Thermese (see the wiki above for more info) and then making Thermese Blocks which can be an effective tool for renewable heating. Thermese Blocks can heat up when cooked in a standard furnace or when adjacent to a lava source, and then inserted into a machine to deposit its heat. You will receive the unheated block back, and can reuse it as many times as you like.

More high-powered and speedy methods are through dedicated Heater machines-- the Furnace Heater or Solar Heater-- which build heat through burning fuel or from sunlight then can provide heat to adjacent machines. Presently these ONLY work with adjacent machinery, but there is always the option of moving the machine since like all other machines, they retain their stored heat when broken.

### Flux Metal
The Terumetal Alloy Smelter is a specialized smelter only for making alloys from combining Terumetal and other materials, therefore it has an internal tank especially for molten Terumetal. This tank is the meter in the center of the screen to the left. It can be filled by inserting raw lumps of Terumetal into the input slot (*not* ingots) then waiting a few seconds for each lump to melt. Naturally, this process requires heat and some will be spent by how much flux is melted.

![Alloy Smelter Melting Flux](tutorial/smelter_melting_flux.png)

(some time later...)

![Alloy Smelter Melted Flux](tutorial/smelter_melting_flux_2.png)

When processing materials for alloying a specific amount of molten flux will need to be in the tank to create the alloy. If not enough is present, it will indicate so and how much more is required until alloying can begin.

## Alloys
In total there are five alloys the smelter can create all based on Terumetal and other materials available in the default Minetest game world. Each of them can be used to create hardened metal blocks and tools of considerable speed and durability. Each alloy has much greater tool performance than any of their constituent materials.

(new in v1.3) If you have the mod unified_inventory installed, you can look up the names of these alloys and view the recipes in-game.

| Material | Flux/Ingot* | Time* | Alloy |  |
|----------------------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Copper Lump | 1 | 3 sec. | Terucopper | ![Terucopper Ingot](terumet/textures/terumet_ingot_tcop.png) |
| Iron Lump | 2 | 4 sec. | Terusteel | ![Terusteel Ingot](terumet/textures/terumet_ingot_tste.png) |
| Gold Lump | 3 | 4 sec. | Terugold | ![Terugold Ingot](terumet/textures/terumet_ingot_tgol.png) |
| Bronze Ingot + 2 Tin Lumps | 3 | 4.5 sec. | Teruchalcum | ![Teruchalcum Ingot](terumet/textures/terumet_ingot_tcha.png) |
| Diamond + Obsidian Shard | 5 | 10 sec. | Coreglass | ![Coreglass Ingot](terumet/textures/terumet_ingot_cgls.png) |

*note: Flux required and time shown are default and can be modified in options.lua.

Like melting flux, creating an alloy requires heat. The amount of heat required is dependent on how long the alloying process takes; therefore, the alloys that require more time also require more heat.

Each of the four alloys can also be created in **block form** by inserting a block of the source material -- a Copper Block instead of a Copper Lump or a Diamond Block and Obsidian Block for Coreglass -- alloying an entire block will take longer along with the required preperation of making the blocks but will consume quite a bit less flux than doing them individually.

To create an alloy simply place the source materials into the input, and if there's enough molten flux all that's left is to wait. If an insufficient amount of flux is in the internal tank the smelter will indicate how much additional flux is required.
