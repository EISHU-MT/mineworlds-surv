# Contributing Guidelines
If you want to contribute, please do so, either through issues or pull requests.

Feel free to report any problems or suggestions (including things as small as typos). If you know how to fix it, a PR would be even more useful.

Translations and textures are also welcome! I don't really like the textures for a lot of things. Mostly the nodes, but textures for the tools that don't look quite so similar to EE2/ProjectE would be nice.

Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing.
